![Statue 1](../public/images/Statue1.jpeg)

## Elements

- **White Horse**: an eternal spiritual vehicle
- **White Sword**: spiritual discrimination
- **White Wings**: angel-like control of the metaphysical element Air
- **White Halo**: a sign of Sainthood, intrinsically linked to the wings
- **No facial features**: Jeanne reduced to her archetype
- **Smoky color of her body**: death by burning and asphyxiation with smoke
- **Perfection of her body and the spiritual (white) interface with the horse**
- **White Standard**: the symbol of strategy and eternal objective
- **Action Figure**: Jeanne d'Arc in the form of an action figure is true to her calling. It activates the ideals of fortitude, action, and loyalty to ideals in the target audience. We should not forget that Jeanne herself was at the age of playing with dolls when she had her first visions.
