                <p>
                    On October 22, 1422, Charles VI died, bequeathing, by the
                    Treaty of Troyes, his kingdom with the hand of his daughter
                    to Henry V, King of England.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the century since war devastated our country, never has
                    our independence been so threatened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Masters of Guyenne, united on one side with the Duke of
                    Burgundy, on the other supported by the Duke of Brittany,
                    the English held the north and center of France, as far as
                    the Loire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Orléans, besieged, presented a final obstacle to their march
                    towards the south; but the city without help was going to
                    succumb.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Dauphin Charles VII had taken refuge in Bourges: a sad
                    king, without an army, without money, without energy. A few
                    courtiers were still competing for the last favors of this
                    sinking monarchy, but none of them was capable of defending
                    it, and, across the hungry countryside, the remnants of the
                    royal army, bands of road warriors from all sources, reduced
                    and demoralized by their recent defeats at Cravant and
                    Verneuil, fell back incapable of a new effort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everything was lacking: men, resources, even the will to
                    resist. Charles VI, despairing of his cause, thought of
                    fleeing to Dauphiné, perhaps even beyond the mountains, to
                    Castile, abandoning his kingdom, his rights, and his duties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the madness of Charles VI, the indolence of the
                    Dauphin, and the selfishness and incapacity of the nobility,
                    had completed the ruin of the country, our very race was
                    going to lose its nationality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, on the borders of Lorraine, in a remote village, a
                    little peasant girl stood up. Moved with pity by the
                    miseries of the poor people of France, she had felt in the
                    depths of her heart the first thrill of the homeland. With
                    her weak hand, she picked up the great sword of vanquished
                    France, and, with her frail chest making a bulwark against
                    so much distress, she drew from the energy of her faith the
                    strength to raise up the lost courage and to uproot our
                    country to the victorious English.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I come from my Lord God,” she said, “to save the kingdom of
                    France.”
                </p>
                <p>And she added: “This is what I was born for.”</p>
                <p>
                    It is for this, in fact, that she was born, the holy girl;
                    this is also why, delivered cowardly to her enemies, she
                    died in the horror of the cruelest torture, abandoned by the
                    King she had crowned and the people she had saved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Open, my dear children, this book with devotion in memory of
                    this humble peasant woman who is the patroness of France,
                    who is the saint of the homeland as she was its martyr. His
                    story will tell you that to win, you must have faith in
                    victory. Remember this, the day when the country will need
                    all your courage.

                <h3>Scene 1</h3>

                />
                <p>
                    Joan was born on January 6, 1412, in Domrémy, a small
                    village in Lorraine, dependent on the bailiwick of Chaumont,
                    which came under the crown of France.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her father's name was Jacques d'Arc, and her mother was
                    Isabelle Romée; they were honest people, simple laborers
                    living from their work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joan was raised with her brothers and her sister in a small
                    house that can still be seen in Domrémy, so close to the
                    church that its garden touches the cemetery.
                </p>
                <p>The child grows up there under the eye of God.</p>
                <p>
                    She was sweet, simple, and straight. Everyone loved her
                    because they knew she was charitable and the best girl in
                    her village. Diligent at work, she helped her family in
                    their tasks, during the day leading the animals to pasture,
                    or taking part in her father's hard work, in the evening
                    spending time with her mother and assisting her in the care
                    of the household.
                </p>
                <p>She loved God and prayed to Him often.</p>
                <h3>Scene 2</h3>
                <img
          src="../public/Boutet/cropped/919977ilsdl.jpg"
          height="400"
                />
                <p>
                    One summer day, when she was thirteen years old, as it was
                    noon, she heard a voice in her father's garden; a great
                    light broke out, and the archangel Saint Michael appeared to
                    her. He told her to be good and to attend church. Then,
                    telling her of the great pity that was in the kingdom of
                    France, he announced to her that she would go to the aid of
                    the Dauphin and that she would take him to Reims for
                    coronation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Sir, I am only a poor girl, I cannot ride or lead
                    men-at-arms."
                </p>
                <p>"God will help you", replied the archangel.</p>
                <p>And the upset child remained crying.</p>
                <h3>Scene 3</h3>
                <img
                    src="../public/Boutet/cropped/919978ilsdl.jpg"
                    height="400"
                />
                <p>
                    From that day on, Joan's piety became even more ardent; The
                    child willingly separated herself from her companions to
                    meditate, and heavenly voices were heard, speaking to her of
                    her mission. They were, she said, the voices of her Saints.
                    Often these voices were accompanied by visions; Saint
                    Catherine and Saint Marguerite appeared to her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I saw them with the eyes of my body,” she later told her
                    judges, “and when they left me I cried; I would have liked
                    them to take me with them.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The child grew up, her spirit exalted by his visions and
                    keeping deep in her heart the secret of her celestial
                    conversations. No one suspected what was happening inside
                    her, not even the priest who heard her confession.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of the year 1428, Joan was eighteen years
                    old, and the voices became more urgent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The danger is great, Joan has to leave to help the King and
                    save the kingdom.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her Saints ordered her to go find the Lord of Baudricourt,
                    Lord of Vaucouleurs, and to ask him for an escort who would
                    take her to the Dauphin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not daring to share her plan with her parents, Joan went to
                    Burey to find her uncle Laxart and begged him to take her to
                    Vaucouleurs. The ardor of her prayer shook the timidity of
                    the fearful peasant; he promised to accompany her.
                </p>
                <h3>Scene 4</h3>
                <img
                    src="../public/Boutet/cropped/919979ilsdl.jpg"
                    height="400"
                />
                <p>
                    Baudricourt's reception was brutal. Joan told him "that a
                    message came from God, that God would command the Dauphin to
                    behave well because the Lord would give him help before the
                    middle of Lent"; she added "that God wanted the Dauphin to
                    become King; that he would do so in spite of his enemies,
                    and that she herself would lead him to the coronation".
                </p>
                <p>
                    "This girl is crazy, said Baudricourt, let’s take her back
                    to her father to give her a good pair of slaps."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joan returned to Domrémy. But pressed again by her voices,
                    she returned to Vaucouleurs and saw the Lord of Baudricourt
                    again without obtaining a better welcome.
                </p>
                <h3>Scene 5</h3>
                <img
                    src="../public/Boutet/cropped/919980ilsdl.jpg"
                    height="400"
                />
                <p>But this time she stayed in Vaucouleurs.</p>
                <p>
                    vSoon the only noise in the country was about this young
                    girl, who was going around saying loudly that she would save
                    the kingdom, that she must be taken to the Dauphin, that God
                    wanted it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I will go,” she said, “even if I wear out my legs up to my
                    knees.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The people, of simple hearts, moved by her faith, believed
                    in her. A squire, Jean de Metz, won by the confidence of the
                    crowd, offered to take her to Chinon, where Charles VII was.
                    The poor people, uniting their miseries, joined together to
                    clothe and arm the little peasant girl. They bought her a
                    horse, and on the appointed day she set out with her weak
                    escort.
                </p>
                <p>“Go. And come what may!” Baudricourt threw her.</p>
                <p>
                    "God bless you!" cried the poor people, and the women wept
                    as they saw her go away.
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 6</h3>
                <img
                    src="../public/Boutet/cropped/919981ilsdl.jpg"
                    height="400"
                />
                <p>
                    Chinon was far away and the journey perilous. The English
                    and Burgundian partisans held the country, and the small
                    troop was obliged to pass through certain bridges which the
                    enemy occupied. You had to walk at night and hide during the
                    day. Joan's companions, frightened, talked of returning to
                    Vaucouleurs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Fear nothing, she told them, God gives me my way, my
                    brothers in paradise tell me what I have to do."
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the twelfth day, Joan arrived in Chinon with her
                    companions. From the hamlet of Saint Catherine, she had sent
                    a letter to the King announcing her arrival.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The court of Charles VII was far from unanimous on the
                    reception which should be given to her. La Trémouille, the
                    favorite of the day, jealous of the ascendancy she had
                    gained over his master, was determined to remove any
                    influence capable of tearing Charles from his torpor. For
                    two days, the council discussed whether the Dauphin would
                    receive the inspired young woman.

                <p>
                    At that moment, news arrived from Orléans so disturbing that
                    Joan's supporters managed to ensure that this supreme chance
                    of salvation was not ruled out. In the evening, by the light
                    of fifty torches, in the great hall of the castle, where all
                    the lords of the court crowded together, Joan was
                    introduced. She had never seen the King. Charles VII, in
                    order not to attract her attention, wore a less luxurious
                    costume than those of his courtiers. At first glance, she
                    distinguished him among all, and kneeling before him:
                </p>
                <p>“God bless you, kind Dauphin!” she says</p>
                <p>
                    "I am not the King," he replied, “this is the King.” And he
                    designated a lord for him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You are, kind prince, and no other; the King of Heaven
                    sends you word through me that you will be crowned."
                </p>
                <p>
                    And approaching the object of her mission, she told him that
                    God had sent her to help and succor; she asked that he give
                    her an army, promising to lift the siege of Orléans and take
                    him to Reims.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Dauphin remained hesitant. This girl could be a witch.
                    He sent her to Poitiers to submit to the examination of
                    doctors and ecclesiastics.
                </p>
                <h3>Scene 8</h3>
                <img

                    height="400"
                />
                <p>
                    For three weeks she was tortured with insidious questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “There is more in God's book than in yours,” she replied; “I
                    know neither A nor B, but I come from the King of Heaven.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    As it was objected to her that God, to deliver France, did
                    not need armed men, she stood up suddenly:
                </p>
                <p>“The men will fight, God will give the victory.”</p>
                <p>
                    There as in Vaucouleurs, the people declared themselves in
                    her favor, they considered her holy and inspired. The
                    doctors and the powerful had to give in to the enthusiasm of
                    the crowd.
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 9</h3>

                />
                <p>
                    The troops gathered in Blois. Joan arrived there followed by
                    the Duke of Alençon, Marshal de Boussac, the Lord of Rais,
                    La Hire, and Xaintrailles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On her white standard, she had the image of God and the names of
                    Jesus and Maria embroidered. She advised her soldiers to
                    sort out their consciences and confess before going out to
                    fight. On Thursday, April 28, the small army set out. Joan
                    led the way, her standard in the wind, to the song of “Veni,
                    Creator”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She wanted to march straight towards Orléans; the leaders
                    thought it more prudent to go via the left bank of the
                    Loire.
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 10</h3>
                <img

                    height="400"
                />
                <p>
                    The army and the convoy arrived in front of Chécy, two
                    leagues above Orléans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was a matter of crossing the Loire; the boats were
                    missing. Joan was transported to the other bank with part of
                    her escort and the convoy of supplies. The rest of the
                    troops had to return to Blois, to return to Orléans via
                    Beauce.
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 11</h3>

                    height="400"
                />
                <p>Joan had said to Dunois, who had come to meet her:</p>
                <p>
                    "I bring you the best help, the help of the King of Heaven;
                    it does not come from me, but from God himself, who, at the
                    request of Saint Louis and Charlemagne, had pity on the city
                    of Orléans."
                </p>
                <p>
                    At eight o'clock in the evening, Joan entered Orléans. The
                    people rushed to meet her. By the light of the torches, she
                    crossed the town in the middle of a crowd so dense that she
                    had difficulty making her way. Everyone, men, women, and
                    children, wanted to approach her or at least touch her
                    horse, showing "such great joy as if they had seen God
                    descend among them."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "They felt, says the headquarters diary, comforted and as if
                    relieved by the divine virtue of this simple girl."
                </p>
                <p>Joan spoke to them gently, promising to deliver them.</p>

                <h3>Scene 12</h3>
                <img

                />
                <p>
                    She asked to be taken to a church, wanting above all to give
                    thanks to God.
                </p>
                <p>As an old man said to Joan, speaking of the English:</p>
                <p>
                    “My daughter, they are strong and well fortified, and it
                    will be a great thing to put them out,” she replied: “There
                    is nothing impossible to the power of God.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    And, in fact, her confidence won over everyone around her.
                    The Orleanians, so fearful and discouraged the day before,
                    now fanaticized by her presence, wanted to throw themselves
                    on the enemy and remove their bastilles. Dunois, fearing
                    failure, decided that they would wait for the arrival of the
                    relief army to begin the attack. In the meantime, Joan
                    summoned the English to withdraw and return to their
                    country. They responded with insults.
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 13</h3>

                    height="400"
                />
                <p>
                    However, we received no news from Blois. Dunois, worried,
                    left to hasten the arrival of help. It was time. The
                    Archbishop of Reims, Regnault de Chartres, Chancellor of the
                    King, reconsidering the decisions taken, was going to send
                    the troops back to their garrisons. Dunois obtained to take
                    them to Orléans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Wednesday, May 4, in the morning, Joan, surrounded by all
                    the clergy of the city and followed by a large part of the
                    population, left Orléans; through the English bastilles, she
                    advanced in a grand procession to meet the small army of
                    Dunois, which passed under the protection of the priests and
                    a girl, without the English daring to attack it.
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 14</h3>

                />
                <p>
                    The same day, as Joan was resting, she woke up with a start.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Ah! My God," she cried, "the blood of our people is spilled
                    on the ground!... It's wrong! Why wasn't I woken up?
                    Quickly, my weapons, my horse!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Helped by the women of the house, she quickly armed herself
                    and, jumping into the saddle, she set off at a gallop, her
                    standard in hand, running straight towards the Porte de
                    Bourgogne, so fast that sparks flew from the pavement.
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 15</h3>

                />
                <p>
                    In fact, without warning her, the bastide of Saint-Loup had
                    been attacked. The attack had failed; the French retreated
                    in disorder. Joan ran to rally them, and, bringing them back
                    to the enemy, she recommenced the assault. In vain Talbot
                    tried to help his people. Joan, standing at the foot of the
                    ramparts, encouraged her people. For three hours the English
                    resisted. Despite their desperate defense, the bastide was
                    taken.
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 16</h3>

                />
                <p>
                    Joan returned victorious to Orléans. But as, in the joy of
                    her success, she returned towards the city, crossing the
                    battlefield, she felt her poor heart melt with pity at the
                    sight of the wounded and the killed, and she began to cry,
                    thinking that they had died without confession. And she said
                    “that she had never seen the blood of France being spilled
                    before. Her hair stood on end.”
                </p>

                />
                <p>
                    However, it was a question of deciding how this attack which
                    had so happily begun would be continued against the English.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chiefs, unconcerned about letting themselves be led by a
                    country girl or sharing with her the glory of success, met
                    in secret to discuss the plan to adopt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joan presented herself to the council; and as the chancellor
                    of the Duke of Orléans sought to conceal from her the
                    decisions that had been taken:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Say what you have concluded and said,” she cried, indignant
                    at these subterfuges; “I can conceal something greater!” she
                    added:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You have been in your counsel and I have been in mine, and
                    believe that the counsel of God will be fulfilled and will
                    stand firm, and that yours will perish. Get up early
                    tomorrow morning, for I will have much to do, more than I
                    ever had."
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 18</h3>

                <p>
                    The next day, May 6, she captured the Augustinian bastille.
                    On Saturday 7, early in the morning, the attack on the
                    Tournelles bastille began. Joan, lowered into the ditch, was
                    raising a ladder against the parapet, when a crossbow bolt
                    pierced her right through between the neck and the shoulder.
                    She tore the iron from the wound; she was then offered to
                    charm the wound, she refused, saying "that she would rather
                    die than do anything that was against the will of God". She
                    confessed and prayed for a long time while her troops
                    rested. Then giving the order to restart the assault, she
                    threw herself into the heat of the fight, shouting to the
                    attackers:
                </p>
                <p>“It’s all yours, come in!”</p>
                <p>
                    The bastille was taken, and all the defenders perished.
                    There was no longer an Englishman left on the left bank of
                    the Loire.

                />
                <p>
                    On Sunday, the English lined up in battle on the right bank
                    of the Loire. Joan forbade attacking them. She had an altar
                    erected, and mass was celebrated in the presence of the
                    assembled army. The ceremony finished, she said to those
                    around her:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “See if the English have their faces turned towards us or
                    their backs!” And as she was told that they were retreating
                    in the direction of Meung:

                    please Lord God that we fight them today, you will have them
                    another time."

                    Orléans, besieged for eight months, was delivered in four
                    days.

                    The news of the deliverance of Orléans spread far and wide,
                    attesting to all the divinity of Joan's mission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The holy girl, avoiding the recognition of the Orléanais,
                    returned hastily to Chinon. She wanted, taking advantage of
                    the enthusiasm raised around her, to leave immediately for
                    Reims, taking the King with her in order to have him
                    crowned. The King welcomed her with great honors, but
                    refused to follow her. He accepted the devotion of this
                    heroic girl, but he understood that her generous efforts
                    would in no way disturb the cowardly inertia of her royal
                    existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was decided that Joan would attack the places that the
                    English still held on the banks of the Loire.

                <p>
                    On June 11, the French occupied the suburbs of Jargeau. The
                    next day, first thing in the morning, Joan gave the signal
                    for combat. The Duke of Alençon wanted to delay the assault:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Forward, kind duke, to the attack! Do not doubt, it is the
                    hour when it pleases God; work, and God will work."
                </p>
                <p>
                    She herself climbed the ladder; she was knocked down by a
                    stone which hit her on the head. But she got up, shouting to
                    her people:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Friends, up! up! Our sire has condemned the English; they
                    are ours at this hour; have good courage!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ramparts were scaled. The English, pursued as far as the
                    town bridge, were caught and killed. Suffolk was taken
                    prisoner.
                </p>
                <p>On the 15th, the French took control of the Meung bridge;</p>
                <p>on the 16th, they laid siege to Beaugency;</p>
                <p>on the 17th, the city capitulated.</p>

                <p>
                    On June 18, Joan reached, near Patay, the English army led
                    by Talbot and Fastolf.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “In the name of God we must fight them,” she said; "even if
                    they hang by the clouds, we will have them, because God
                    sends them to us so that we can punish them. Our kind King
                    will have today the greatest victory that he ever had."
                </p>
                <p>
                    She wanted to go to the vanguard, but she was held back, and
                    La Hire was charged with attacking the English to force them
                    to turn around, in order to give the French troops time to
                    arrive. But La Hire's attack was so impetuous that
                    everything gave way before him. When Joan ran with her
                    men-at-arms, the English were retreating in disorder. Their
                    retreat became a rout.
                </p>
                <p>Talbot was taken prisoner.</p>
                <p>
                    "You didn’t think this morning that this would happen to
                    you," said the Duke of Alençon.
                </p>
                <p>"It is the fortune of war," replied Talbot.</p>

                <h3>Scene 23</h3>
                <img src="../public/Boutet/cropped/919999ilsdl.jpg"
                    height="400" />
                <p>
                    The English lost four thousand dead. Two hundred prisoners
                    were taken from them. Only those who could pay a ransom were
                    kept at mercy; the others were killed mercilessly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of them was beaten so brutally in front of Joan that she
                    jumped from her horse to help him. She lifted the poor man's
                    head, brought a priest to him, consoled him, and helped him
                    die.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her heart was as pitiful for the wounded English as for
                    those of her party
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides, she defied blows, and was often wounded, but never
                    wanted to use her sword; her white standard was her only weapon.
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 24</h3>
                <img src="../public/Boutet/cropped/920000ilsdl.jpg" height="400" />
                <p>
                    The soldiers, English and Burgundians, who were garrisoning
                    Troyes were able to leave the city with everything they
                    owned. What they had were mainly prisoners, French people.
                    When drawing up the capitulation, nothing had been
                    stipulated in favor of these unfortunate people. But when
                    the English left the city with their garroted prisoners,
                    Joan threw herself across the road.
                </p>
                <p>“In God’s name, you will not take them!” she cried.</p>
                <p>
                    She demanded that the prisoners be handed over to her, and
                    that their ransom be paid by the King.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On July 16, the King entered the city of Reims at the head
                    of his troops. The next day, the coronation ceremony took
                    place in the cathedral, amid a great concourse of lords and
                    people. Joan stood behind the King, her standard in her
                    hand;
                </p>
                <p>
                    "This standard had suffered, it was right that it should be
                    in the spotlight."
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 26</h3>

                /> 
                <p>
                    When Charles VII had received the sacred anointing and the
                    crown from the archbishop, Regnault of Chartres, Joan threw
                    herself at his feet, kissing his knees and weeping hot
                    tears.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “O kind Sire,” she said, “now is fulfilled the pleasure of
                    God who wanted me to bring you to your city of Reims to
                    receive your holy coronation, showing that you are true
                    king, and that the kingdom of France must belong to you !”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “All those who saw it at that moment,” says the old
                    chronicle, “believed better than ever that it was something
                    from God.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “O good and devout people,” cried the holy girl, seeing the
                    enthusiasm of the crowd around the King, “if I must die, I
                    would be very happy if they buried me here!”
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 27</h3>

                    height="400"
                />
                <p>
                    There was nothing like the eagerness of the people to touch
                    Joan. It was about who would kiss her hands or her clothes,
                    who would touch her. The little children were presented to
                    her so that she could bless them, the rosaries, the holy
                    images so that she could sanctify them by touching them with
                    her hand. And the humble girl gracefully rejected these
                    signs of adoration, gently joking with the poor people about
                    their credulity in her power. But she asked on what day and
                    at what time the children of the poor received communion, to
                    go and commune with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her pity was for all those who suffered, but her tenderness
                    was all for the small and humble. She felt like their
                    sister, knowing that she was born to one of them. When later
                    she was criticized for having tolerated this adoration of
                    the crowd, Joan will simply respond: "
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many people saw me willingly, and they kissed my hands
                    without my permission, but the poor people came willingly to
                    me because I did not displease them."
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 28</h3>
                <img src="../public/Boutet/cropped/920004ilsdl.jpg"

                />
                <p>
                    After the coronation of Reims, Joan wanted to move strongly
                    towards Paris and retake the capital of the kingdom. The
                    King's indecision gave the English time to make their
                    defense preparations. The assault was repulsed; Joan was
                    wounded by a crossbow bolt to the thigh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She had to be taken by force from the foot of the ramparts
                    to force her to stop the fight. The next day, the King
                    opposed the recommencement of the attack; Joan, however, was
                    responsible for the lack of success.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For quite a long time Charles had been dragged along the
                    roads; he was impatient to resume his indolent life in his
                    castles of Touraine.
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 29</h3>
                <img src="../public/Boutet/cropped/920005ilsdl.jpg" height="400" />
                <p>
                    This retreat imposed by the cowardice of Charles VII and the
                    jealousy of the courtiers was a terrible attack on Joan's
                    prestige.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From now on, in everyone's eyes, she ceased to be
                    invincible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The holy girl seems to have understood this, because, before
                    leaving Paris, she went to place as an offering, on the
                    altar of Saint-Denis, her hitherto victorious weapons. She
                    prayed for a long time. Perhaps at that moment she had a
                    presentiment that her glorious mission was over, and that
                    painful trials were ahead for her. Nevertheless, she
                    submitted and, with death in her soul, followed the King to
                    Gien. The army was disbanded. The people of the court
                    thought that we had fought enough. It was important,
                    moreover, for their jealousy to put an end to Joan's
                    success.
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 30</h3>

                <p>
                    But Joan could not resign herself to the inaction that they
                    wanted to impose on her. Abandoned without help during the
                    siege of La Charité, she understood that she now had no hope
                    of help from Charles VII. At the end of March (1430),
                    without taking leave of the King, she left to join the
                    French partisans who were skirmishing against the English at
                    Lagny.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, during Easter week, as she had just heard mass and
                    taken communion in the church Saint-Jacques de Compiègne,
                    she withdrew against a pillar of the church and began to
                    cry. The townspeople and children were surrounding her - she
                    said to them:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "My children and dear friends, I tell you that I have been
                    sold and betrayed, and that soon I will be delivered to
                    death. I beg you to pray for me, because I will never again
                    have the power to do any service to the King and the Kingdom
                    of France."
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 31</h3>

                <p>
                    On May 23, as she was in Crespy, she learned that the town
                    of Compiègne was closely sieged by the English and the
                    Burgundians.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She went there with four hundred combatants and entered the
                    city on the 24th, at daybreak. Then, taking part of the
                    garrison with her, she attacked the Burgundians. But the
                    English came to attack her. The French retreated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Don’t think about anything but shooting at them,” Joan
                    shouted, “it’s up to you that they get unnerved!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    But Joan was carried away by the retreat of her people.
                    Brought back under the ramparts of Compiègne, the French
                    found the bridge raised and the portcullis lowered. However,
                    Joan, forced into the ditches, still defended herself.
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 32</h3>
                <img src="../public/Boutet/cropped/920008ilsdl.jpg" height="400" />
                <p>A troop had attacked her.</p>
                <p>
                    "Surrender yourself!" they shouted to her. “I have sworn and
                    pledged my faith to someone other than you,” replied the
                    brave girl, “and I will keep my oath!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    But in vain she resisted. Pulled by her long clothes, she
                    was knocked from her horse and taken. From the top of the
                    city ramparts, the Lord of Flavy, governor of Compiègne,
                    witnessed his capture. He did nothing to help her.
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 33</h3>
                <img src="../public/Boutet/cropped/920009ilsdl.jpg" height="400" />
                <p>
                    Joan was taken to Margny amid the cries of joy of her
                    enemies. The English and Burgundian chiefs and the Duke of
                    Burgundy himself came running to see the witch. They found
                    themselves face to face with an eighteen year old girl. Joan
                    was the prisoner of John of Luxembourg, a gentleman without
                    fortune, who only wanted to profit from her capture. The
                    king of France made no offer to ransom the captive.
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 34</h3>
                <img src="../public/Boutet/cropped/920010ilsdl.jpg" height="400" />
                <p>
                    Joan was locked up in the Château de Beaurevoir. But knowing
                    that the English wanted to buy her from the Lord of
                    Luxembourg and also that the siege of Compiègne was
                    advancing and that the city was going to succumb, one night
                    she let herself slide from the top of the keep, using straps
                    that broke. She fell at the foot of the wall and remained
                    there as if dead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joan, however, recovers from her fall. A crueler end was in
                    store for her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of November, she was handed over to the English
                    for a sum of ten thousand tournois pounds.
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 35</h3>
                <img src="../public/Boutet/cropped/920011ilsdl.jpg" height="400" />
                <p>
                    Locked in the prison of Rouen Castle, she was guarded day
                    and night by soldiers, from whom she had to endure insults
                    and even brutality, her chains not allowing her to defend
                    herself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, a tribunal, at the discretion of the English
                    party and chaired by Cauchon, bishop of Beauvais, was
                    investigating her trial. To the insidious questions of her
                    judges, the poor and holy girl, without support and without
                    advice, could only oppose the righteousness and simplicity
                    of her heart, only the purity of her intentions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I come from God,” she said; “I have no use here; send me
                    back to God from whom I came.”
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 36</h3>
                <img src="../public/Boutet/cropped/920012ilsdl.jpg" height="400" />
                <p>
                    However, there remained one help for her: that of her
                    saints. They alone had not abandoned her. Joan always
                    received advice from her celestial voices; Saint Marguerite
                    and Saint Catherine appeared to her in the silence of the
                    night, comforting her with good words. And as Bishop Cauchon
                    asked Joan what they said to her:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “They woke me up,” she replied, “I folded my hands and asked
                    them to give me advice; they said to me: ‘Ask Our Lord.’”
                </p>
                <p>“And what else did they say?”</p>
                <p>“To answer you boldly.”</p>
                <p>And as the bishop pressed her with questions:</p>
                <p>
                    "I can't say everything; I'm more afraid of saying something
                    that displeases them than I am of not responding to you."
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 37</h3>
                <img src="../public/Boutet/cropped/920013ilsdl.jpg" height="400" />
                <p>
                    One day, Stafford and Warwick came to see her with Jean de
                    Luxembourg. And as he, mockingly, told her that he was
                    coming to buy her back if she promised not to arm herself
                    against England again:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “In the name of God,” she replied, “you are making fun of
                    me, because I know very well that you have neither the will
                    nor the power; I know very well that the English will put me
                    to death, believing, after my death, to gain the kingdom of
                    France; but even if they were a hundred thousand more, they
                    would not have the kingdom."
                </p>
                <p>Furious, the Earl of Stafford threw himself at her.</p>
                <p>
                    He would have killed her without the intervention of the
                    assistants.
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 38</h3>
                <img src="../public/Boutet/cropped/920014ilsdl.jpg" height="400" />
                <p>
                    Joan, treated as a heretic, was deprived of the aid of
                    religion. The sacraments were forbidden to her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Returning from the interrogation and passing with her escort
                    in front of a chapel whose door was closed, she asked the
                    monk who accompanied her if the body of Jesus Christ was
                    there, requesting that she be allowed to kneel for a moment
                    in front of the door to pray. Which she did. Now, Cauchon,
                    having known this, threatened the monk with the most
                    rigorous punishments if such a thing happened again.
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 39</h3>
                <img src="../public/Boutet/cropped/920015ilsdl.jpg" height="400" /> <img src="../public/Boutet/cropped/920016ilsdl.jpg" height="400" />
                <p>However, the trial moved too slowly for the English.</p>
                <p>
                    “Judges, you don’t earn your money!” they shouted to the
                    members of the court.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I have come to the King of France,” said Joan, “from God,
                    from the Virgin Mary, the saints and the victorious Church
                    above; to that Church I submit myself, my works, what I have
                    done or to do. You say that you are my judges, be careful
                    about what you do, because truly I am sent from God and you
                    are putting yourself in great danger!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The holy heroine was condemned, as a heretic, relapse,
                    apostate, and idolater, to be burned alive on the Place du
                    Vieux-Marché in Rouen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Bishop, I die because of you!” she said, addressing
                    Cauchon.
                </p>

                <h3>Scene 40</h3>
                <img src="../public/Boutet/cropped/920017ilsdl.jpg" height="400" /> <img src="../public/Boutet/cropped/920018ilsdl.jpg" height="400" />
                <p>
                    On May 30, Joan confessed and received communion. Then she
                    was taken to the place of execution. When she was at the
                    foot of the scaffold, she knelt, invoking God, the Virgin,
                    and the Saints; then, turning to the bishop, to the judges,
                    to her enemies, she devoutly begged them to have masses said
                    for her soul. She climbed on the stake, asked for a cross,
                    and died in the flames while pronouncing the name of Jesus.
                    Everyone was crying, the executioners themselves and the
                    judges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We are lost, we have burned a saint!” cried the English as
                    they dispersed.
                </p>
                <h3>Outro</h3>
                <p> Christ, forgive Rouen. They  don't know what they're doing...

                </p>
                <p>Jesus, Jesus, why have you forgotten me?
                
                </p>
                <p>Lord, into your hand, I commend my spirit.
